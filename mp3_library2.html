                    'Messiah' Practice MP3 Files
                </h1>













                <p>
                    Welcome to the Boulder Messiah Sing-Along's MP3 practice library. Here you will find practice files for all of the choruses that we sing
                    during our yearly holiday performances. You'll even find all of the Airs and Recitatives that are sung by our
                    professional soloists in case you'd like to practice those as well (maybe you would like to be a future soloist...?)
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are various Messiah practice web sites already "out there" on the internet. So why create yet another one? <a id='whyHide' href=
                    "javascript:hide('whyThisOne',%20'whyHide',%20'whyShow')" style="display:none" name="whyHide">Hide</a> <a id='whyShow' href=
                    "javascript:show('whyThisOne',%20'whyShow',%20'whyHide')" name="whyShow">Show</a>
                </p>

                <div class="hidable" id="whyThisOne">
                    <p>
                        Here's why...
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Most practice web sites provide their material only in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> format. This has
                        several disadvantages...
                        </li>

                        <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Most portable audio devices don't support MIDI, so in order to listen to MIDI, you generally have to be tethered to your
                                computer.
                                </li>

                                <li>The players on those devices that do support MIDI use digital "instruments" that sound like something produced by a toy
                                keyboard. So the sound of the MIDI practice pieces is, to put it bluntly, lousy.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>Those web sites that provide MP3 files (which can be downloaded to your portable audio device, such as an iPod) have generally just
                        taken their poor-quality MIDI files and converted them to poor-quality MP3 files.
                        </li>

                        <li>Some web sites provide their practice pieces only with digitized piano accompaniment. Since we do our performances with a full
                        orchestra, I felt it more useful to provide set of files that has full orchestral accompaniment.
                        </li>

                        <li>Other practice sites conform to other versions of the Messiah (e.g. Watkins Shaw). We use the Schirmer version in our
                        sing-alongs, and so want practice pieces to conform to that version.
                        </li>

                        <li>We have no control (volume, tempo, wrong notes, etc.) over the material on other websites.
                        </li>

                        <li>Even if we did find an MP3 practice site that met our criteria, we have no control over its future availability. It could 'go away'
                        at any time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I felt that I could improve on what's already "out there", so on <em><u><strong>this</strong></u></em> web site you will find what I
                        believe are practice files that are higher quality than what you'll find elsewhere on the internet. "Real" orchestral instruments have
                        been used for both the orchestra accompaniment as well as the SATB voice parts (click <a href="mp3_technology2.html">here</a> for more
                        details on these "real" instruments). I have gone through each and every chorus, for every voice part, and done my utmost to ensure
                        that every note agrees with the Schirmer score. I have also adjusted the tempos so that they come close to the tempos that we use in
                        practices and performances. Hopefully you will find these files useful in your preparation for our annual performances.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    	As for the non-Chorus pieces, I wasn't as fussy with those in terms of ensuring exact
                        adherance to the Schirmer edition. You will hear a few differences, mainly in that some of the MP3's have "improvisations"
                        in places and are thus similar to how a soloist might "jazz" them up during a performance.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Listening options... <a id='listenHide' href="javascript:hide('howToListen',%20'listenHide',%20'listenShow')" style="display:none" name=
                    "listenHide">Hide</a> <a id='listenShow' href="javascript:show('howToListen',%20'listenShow',%20'listenHide')" name="listenShow">Show</a>
                </p>

                <div class="hidable" id="howToListen">
                    <p>
                        The easiest way to listen is to simply click a file of interest to listen to it on your computer or portable device (smart phone, iPad, etc). When listening on your computer
                        headphones are recommended, since the built-in speaker in most home computers is about the size of a half-dollar coin and is designed
                        more for producing a 'beep' sound than for reproducing high-fidelity audio.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you <em><strong>download</strong></em> the files to your computer your options increase, as you can then...
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Listen to them over and over on your computer without the delay inherent in downloading them each time you want to listen.
                        </li>

                        <li>Copy the MP3 files to your MP3 player and take them with you on walks, in the car, etc.
                        </li>

                        <li>Copy the MP3 files to a memory stick (aka 'Jump Drive' or 'Thumb Drive') and play them in any device that supports playback from a
                        memory stick (many newer car radios now support this).
                        </li>

                        <li>Burn the MP3 files onto a CD and listen to them on a variety of devices that support MP3 CDs. This includes almost all car radios
                        that have a CD player. Additionally, practically all newer DVD players now support playing MP3 CDs, so you could even listen to them
                        through your TV speakers by playing them in the DVD player connected to your TV. Portable 'laptop' DVD players usually support playing
                        MP3 CD's, so you could listen that way with a set of headphones.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Most browsers will download a file to your computer if you right-click on the file and then pick the appropriate option from the
                        context menu. The exact wording of the menu item varies from browser to browser:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Firefox -- "Save link as..."
                        </li>

                        <li>Internet Explorer -- "Save target as..."
                        </li>

                        <li>Google Chrome -- "Save link as..."
                        </li>

                        <li>Macintosh -- no idea (volunteers...?)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        After you right-click a file and then click the 'Save...' menu item, a window will appear where you pick the place on your computer
                        where the file is to be saved (remember where you put it!).
                    </p>

<!--
                    <p>
                        If you want <strong>all</strong> of the choruses for your particular voice part, you could certainly download each of them
                        individually. However, to make things easier, I have created .zip files (see the links at the <u>bottom</u> of this page) that contain
                        all 18 pieces for a particular voice part. So, if you "want it all", just download (using the instructions just described above) the
                        appropriate .zip file to your computer, then unpack that .zip file into some directory (how to do this varies from computer to computer
                        and is beyond the scope of this tutorial). Note that on recent Windows systems, Windows Explorer treats .zip files as though they were
                        folders and will show you the files inside of the .zip file just as though they were in a folder like any other file. So in this case,
                        you may not need to bother with 'unpacking' the .zip file.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bear in mind that these .zip files are quite large (~~65MB each), so a high-speed internet connection (or copious patience) is
                        required.
                    </p>
