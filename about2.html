                    Robert Arentz founded the Boulder Messiah Chorale and Orchestra in 1983, out of a desire to provide the Boulder community with a sing-along
                    rendition of Handel's most beloved work, <strong><em>Messiah</em></strong>. The sing-along was founded on a principle of openness -
                    everyone is welcome in the choir, and everyone is welcome in the performance. As an audience member you are not <strong>required</strong>
                    to sing, but you are certainly <strong>invited</strong> to sing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although in his own words he is "not particularly religious," the <em>Messiah</em> touches him deeply. His first experience was in 1981,
                    when he was asked to turn pages for the organist in a <em>Messiah</em> performance. As the chords of the Hallelujah Chorus swelled
                    and grew, he was overcome with emotion at the power and majesty of what he was hearing all around him. By the time the final "Hallelujah"
                    rang out, tears were streaming down his cheeks. He decided then to conduct a public sing-along of the <em>Messiah</em>, and these concerts
                    are held every year in Boulder around Christmas time. Bob knows that there is something deep and powerful and wonderful behind this music,
                    and he wants to be a part of that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now in its <b>41st</b> year, the Boulder Messiah Sing-Along has become a beloved community tradition for those in Boulder, Colorado, the
                    surrounding communities, and for those visiting the area during the holiday season.

                <p>
                  Kristopher (Kris) Kincheloe currently serves as the Boulder Messiah's House Manager.  Kris has been a choir member for 30 years.  He is a Registered Nurse with University of Colorado Hospital &mdash; a degree he earned while maintaining his involvement (and sanity) with this amazing group of musicians. During rehearsals, Robert would very often share stories reflecting his immense knowledge of Handel and the making of Messiah, as well as anecdotal stories from across his 40 years with his choirs and orchestras, and Kris is proud to continue his support of the tradition that Robert began.

                  Mathieu D'Ordine currently serves as the Boulder Messiah's Music Director, although he played cello in the Messiah orchestra for more than 15 years before stepping onto the podium. A CU Boulder graduate, he spent much of his latter semesters at CU in Macky Auditorium's orchestra pit playing opera, and later conducted several productions for the Boulder Opera Company. Mathieu is proud to continue the tradition that Robert began with the help of the cherished community that has built up around, and within, the Boulder Messiah Chorale and Orchestra.
