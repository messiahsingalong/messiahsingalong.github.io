                            Is this concert appropriate for children?

                        <td class="faqa">
                            It depends upon how precocious the child is. In general, most children find the concert to be very grown-up in nature and therefore
                            boring after just a few minutes of music. In general it is not something that most children can relate to, or appreciate, and
                            therefore the safe answer is: "no." However, some children have an innate relationship with the music and do very well, but this
                            type of child is very uncommon. Most infants do not do well at all in the sing-along environment and almost always become fidgety,
                            and then upset, and then disturbing. We do not exclude children, per se, and leave the final decision to the respective adults
                            involved. As a rule, though, this is for a 15-years and up age group.

                        </td>
                        <td class="faqa">
                            No, not at all. Singing is optional. Thus, if you come with a friend and one of you wants to sing and the other one does not, that
                            is just fine. You can come and simply listen if you want to.

                            Not really. All seating is unassigned, and is therefore "general" in a sense. However, we do set aside a few pews in the front of
                            the main-floor level which are segregated by voice-range (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass.) After that, the rest of the church is
                            open seating and people can sit wherever they like in whatever grouping they care to make.
