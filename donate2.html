                    The Boulder Messiah Chorale and Orchestra has been staging community sing-alongs of the <em>Messiah</em> since 1983. Putting on these performances
                    is an <strong><em><u>enormous</u></em></strong> undertaking, accomplished in part via the efforts of many volunteers who are happy and
                    eager to lend their labor and talent to help keep this community tradition alive. But even with an army of happy, eager volunteers, some
                    things still cost money: professional musicians must be paid, newspaper advertisements must be purchased, performance and practice venues
                    must be rented, programs must be printed, ......
                </p>

                <p>
                    Income from ticket sales accounts for only a portion of the production costs. We rely on community donations to help fill in the gaps. Your
                    donation of any amount would be most appreciated and would help ensure that this cherished community tradition continues well into the
                    future. The Boulder Messiah Chorale and Orchestra is a 501(c)(3) non-profit musical organization, which means that your donation is eligible for a tax deduction (subject to your own personal tax situation).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are happy to accept your donation in any of the following ways:
                </p>
